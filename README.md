# WorldCup
This program is about generating a road map of matches and related goal statistics in the FIFA World Cup Final. The game is repeated until your favourite soccer team (country) wins the Final in a tournament, or until a maximum number of tournaments. For simplicity, we will start from the Round of 16. Assume that you are given the list of 16 countries in an array. You will ask the user for his/her favourite team (keyboard input). Your program will then output a possible road map of 8 matches in the Round of 16, 4 Quarter Finals, 2 Semi-Finals, 1 Final, and the final winner of a tournament. A tournament is repeated (with the same list of countries) until the userâ€™s chosen team wins, or the max number of tournaments specified in the program has reached (e.g., 20 tournaments). At the end, you will show total scores in each match, the average goals for each tournament, the overall average for all tournaments in the game, and the total number of matches where the number of goals is greater than the overall average.

Note that a match is played between two teams/countries, a tournament consists of all the matches leading to a final winner (i.e., all matches including the final), and the game includes all the tournaments until your favourite team wins, or the max tournament count is reached.
